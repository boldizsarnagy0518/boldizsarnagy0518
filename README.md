# Hi, I’m Boldizsár (Boldi) 👋

I’m a **Data Engineer at Bosch**, focused on building **reliable, scalable data pipelines** with a strong emphasis on **Python, SQL, and data architecture**. My goal is to make data systems predictable, maintainable, and easy to use for analytics and BI teams.

## What I do
- Design and build data workflows primarily with **Python** and **SQL**
- Think in **architecture**: clear boundaries, clean data models, and stable interfaces
- Improve **ETL performance**, data quality, and overall pipeline reliability
- Automate delivery with **CI/CD (Jenkins)**, **Git**, and **Docker** on enterprise Linux environments
- Work with **Azure** to support scalable, cloud-based data solutions

## What I’m learning and exploring
I enjoy **continuous learning** and experimenting with new tools, especially where good engineering meets scalability and AI:
- **Data engineering tools**: **Dagster**, **dbt**, **DuckDB**, **Docker**
- **AI & agentic workflows**: **LangChain** and **LangGraph**
- Building systems where infrastructure supports both analytics and AI use cases

## Outside of tech
I’m also a **competitive powerlifting athlete and coach**. I’ve coached multiple national champions, and one of my athletes joined the **Hungarian national team**. Coaching shaped how I work: disciplined execution, long-term thinking, and turning ambitious goals into structured, step-by-step progress.
